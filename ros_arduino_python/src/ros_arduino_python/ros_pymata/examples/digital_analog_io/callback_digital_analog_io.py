This example illustrates using callbacks for digital input, analog input and analog latches, in addition
to demonstrating both writing to an LED using PWM and with digital outputs.

A switch is used to turn an LED on and off, and a potentiometer sets the intensity of a second LED.
When the potentiometer exceeds a raw value of 1000, the program is terminated.
